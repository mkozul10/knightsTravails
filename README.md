# Knights Travails

Algorithm for finding shortest path between two points on chess borad using Graph data structure.

## Description

A knight in chess can move to any square on the standard 8x8 chess board from any other square on the board. [Animation](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/284f0cdc998be7e4751e29e8458323ad5d320303/ruby_programming/computer_science/project_knights_travails/imgs/00.png)


My task was to build function which takes two endpoints and returns shortest path between the same.
```js
knightMoves([0,0],[1,2]) == [[0,0],[1,2]];
```
